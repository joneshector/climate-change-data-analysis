# Climate Change Data Analysis Project

This project contains my personal research into Climate Change data analytics, include creating ETL pipelines and performing data science techniques to study the trends and forecasts.

The first dataset I am exploring is the [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?resource=download) set.
